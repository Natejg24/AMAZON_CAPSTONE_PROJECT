# AMAZON_CAPSTONE_PROJECT
This project analyzes high-demand, low-competition beauty products on Amazon to identify market opportunities. By examining sales patterns, ratings, pricing, and other metrics across multiple product categories, we aim to identify the most promising beauty niches for potential sellers.

Key Findings
- Hair shampoo and conditioner products show the highest sales potential among analyzed beauty categories
- Prime eligibility significantly increases product sales (by approximately 55%)
- Higher-rated products (4.5+ stars) consistently outperform lower-rated alternatives
- Products priced between $15-30 tend to perform best across most beauty categories
- Face moisturizers command the highest average price point ($29.85) but have moderate sales volume

Business Recommendations
1. Focus on hair care products - particularly shampoos as they show the highest sales potential
2. Prioritize Prime eligibility - ensure your product qualifies for Prime to boost visibility and sales
3. Maintain high quality standards - products need 4.5+ star ratings to maximize sales potential
4. Price strategically - aim for the mid-range sweet spot that balances profit margins with market demand
5. Emphasize key ingredients - highlight popular ingredients specific to each category (hyaluronic acid for moisturizers, etc.)

Model Performance Note
Our predictive model shows limited accuracy in its current form. This suggests that additional factors beyond those analyzed (such as seasonality, ingredient trends, and marketing effectiveness) significantly influence beauty product sales. Next steps include enhancing the model with these additional data points.
